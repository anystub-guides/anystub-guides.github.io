            <h2>What's that</h2>
            <p>
                Anystub wraps function calls and attempts to find a matching calls that has already been made and recorded.
                Two things can then happen:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If there is a matching call, Anystub will recover the result that is associated with call and return.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If there is not a matching call and it is allowed to make the real call, Anystub will make the call,
                    record the result and return it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Recorded calls and corresponding results are stored in files called stub-files.
            </p>
            <p>
                Out of box anyStub includes wrappers for <code>org.apache.http.client.HttpClient</code> from Apache
                HttpClient 4.5.8
                to stub http connections and some interfaces from <code>javax.sql.*</code> to stub DB-connections.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why do you need it</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                make your app independent from external data sources
            </li>
            <li>
                test classes, subsystems or the whole app against real data
            </li>
            <li>
                zero efforts to collect test data
            </li>
            <li>
                make your tests autonomous and running at any isolated build server
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> anyStub provides simple API and requires minimum overhead code to get benefits.</p>

        <h2> How to cook it</h2>
        <p>As you have wrappers you for http and db communications need to inject the objects properly in your
            application
            and let it to work. For stubbing http connection use <code>org.anystub.http.StubHttpClient</code>. The main
            class for stubbing database calls is <code>org.anystub.jdbc.StubDataSource</code>. To wrap the real objects
            use <code>stub(HttpClient httpClient)</code>, <code>stub(DataSource dataSource)</code> static functions of
            the classes. You only need to pass an object configured for real communication.
            More likely have to create/configure a builder or a factory which will create the stubbed connections.
            Examples below demonstrate how to stub real connections in the cases.

        </p>

        <p> Once you stub the connections and run tests all calls will appear in a default-stub file <code>src/test/resources/anystub/stub.yml</code>
            Sometimes you need to split the calls by different stub-files. To do that you can utilize <code>@AnystubId</code>
            annotation. It's a class/method level annotation.
            You can put it with your test class/test method to direct saving all calls under the annotation in a distinct file.
            By default, the file has a name of
            <code>TestClassName.yml/TestMethodName.yml</code> and puts in src/test/resources/anystub/. The annotation
            has a parameter "filename" to
            give the file a specific name. The extension '.yml' will be added automatically.
        </p>

        <p>
            AnyStub library is developed for spring-boot applications to stub external communication.
            In the examples you run the same full spring container. The only difference is a bean wrapped by class from
            anyStun library.

            If you run spring container in tests in a application with a configuration in .xml files you can also
            consider injecting the classes.

        </p>
        <p>
            You can stub any call in your plain-java application. Here is <a
                href="https://github.com/anystub/anystub/blob/anystub-0.2.22/src/test/java/org/anystub/it/WorkerEasyTest.java">an
            example</a> of how to create a wrapper for a method <code>get()</code> of plain java class.
        </p>

        <h4> Remember </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Stubbing inconsistent systems, unstable components and timely available resources is a good idea</li>
            <li>Stubbing low level objects which works behind several levels of abstractions helps to create
                resilient integration tests and increases coverage</li>
            <li>Split and reuse your stubs among tests wisely</li>
            <li>Change or mock behavior of your system less - Try to find suitable data to test all aspects</li>
            <li>You can populate and modify your stub-files to prove your system works</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Become a chief</h2>
        <p>In examples above, the stub files were created as by default with <code>RequestMode.rmNew</code> attribute.
            That means all calls will be assessed against the stub files.
            In case of the call is found in the file the result will be recovered from file and the hit of the real
            system will be procrastinated (or maybe omitted if not required).
            Duplicates of the calls do not appear in the stub-file.
            If AnyStub failed to find a call it will hit the target system, store the call id and
            results in the stub and return the result to caller.
        </p>
        <p>
            AnyStub provides few more modes to proceed calls:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>RequestMode.rmNone</code>
                Sending requests to a real system is forbidden. If request is not found in a stub-file then exception is
                thrown.
            </li>
            <li><code>RequestMode.rmTrack</code>
                If the stub file just created all requests are recorded in the stub file (even if duplicated exists).
                If the stub-file exists
                sending requests to a real system is forbidden. Calls are expected exactly in the same order as it was
                on a record phase.
                If next call doesn't match records in the stub-file the exception thrown.
            </li>
            <li><code>RequestMode.rmAll</code>
                The Stub file clear on the first call. All requests are sent to a real system and results written to the
                stub-file. Duplicated are possible.
            </li>
            <li><code>RequestMode.rmPassThrough</code>
                all calls go directly to a real system.
            </li>
        </ul>
